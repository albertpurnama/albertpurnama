# 👋 Hi, I’m Albert Purnama

I'm a software engineer and founder who loves building fast, practical, and delightful tools—especially at the intersection of AI, infra, and product.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- Writing a hands-on newsletter for engineers exploring cutting-edge tech (coming soon).
- Some side projects that's still fresh in the oven.

### 💼 Previous Startups
- **Typedream** – No-code website builder, acquired by [Beehiiv](https://beehiiv.com).
- **Cotter** – Passwordless login SDK, acquired by [Stytch](https://stytch.com).

### 💻 Languages & Tools
- **TypeScript** / React / Next.js  
- **Go** / Python / Swift  
- Docker / Kubernetes / Redis / Postgres  
- Unity (for fun) and a bit of iOS + hardware tinkering

### 🧠 I Like Thinking About
- AI x UI → how interface shifts can unlock new product categories  
- Startup M&A, earnouts, and engineering team autonomy  
- Making tech more accessible for kids and people from underrepresented regions
